        <p>The process of change that educational institutions have undergone, of providing services
            face-to-face to virtual, has highlighted the different problems that these have.
            Of which one of them and the most important, since that is where the base of
            educational training, is to be able to keep track of the planning processes,
            execution and assessment of competencies during the course of the school year both at the
            of initial, primary and secondary education.</p>

            <p>
                Through our web platform, teachers will be able to self-train and evaluate themselves
                through virtual courses in order to provide a solution to poor quality
                teaching that has been applied in virtual classes.
                And educational institutions will have the ability to carry out proper control
                in the processes of planning, execution and evaluation of competencies during the
                course of the school year using self-training and self-assessment tools,
                on the competencies to be used throughout the school year,
                provided to your team of teachers.
